<p>By default, this advent calendar doesn't display scrollbars on the windows it opens. <p>If you have at lot of content in a window, you might want to add one in. <p>The way you do that is by adding an entry for the array scrollbarsarray[] for the door you want to have one, and setting it to 1. <p>If you look at the main calendar file for door 4, you'll see what I mean.
